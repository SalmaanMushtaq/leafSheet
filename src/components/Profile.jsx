        &emsp;Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ I&apos;m SALMAAN MUSHTAQ, a passionate web
        developer based in Kashmir, India. With a keen eye for design and a love
        for crafting digital experiences, I thrive on turning innovative ideas
        into reality through the power of code. <br />
        &emsp;ðŸš€ My journey in web development began with a curiosity about how
        the web works, and it has since evolved into a dynamic skill set that
        spans HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, ReactJs, JQuery, Bootstrap, and
        Tailwindcss. <br />
        &emsp;Ready to see what I can do? Explore my portfolio to witness the
        projects I&apos;ve brought to life, or feel free to reach out to discuss
        potential collaborations or opportunities. Let&apos;s create something
        amazing together!
